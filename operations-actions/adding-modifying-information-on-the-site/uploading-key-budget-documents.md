# Uploading key budget documents

The key budget documents are shown on the [departments list page](https://vulekamali.gov.za/2020-21/departments) for a given financial year.

We upload the documents to datasets in CKAN because it allows the consistent documents to be categorised consistently, making it easy to find them alongside relevant data, and if someone is looking for all instances of the same document.

In the examples below, 

* if the financial year is 2020-21, treat `<financial year>` as `2020-21`
* for a provncial document, if the province is Limpopo, treat `<province>` as `Limpopo`

## National budget documents

For each document, if the dataset title is the same, then the document should be uploaded as a different resource on the same dataset.

Always specify the financial year, and the sphere as National, with no provinces selected.

The key national budget documents are those on the year's budget page on treasury.gov.za
