National Treasury will receive your request and respond. You can also follow up on your request at [info@vulekamali.gov.za](mailto:info@vulekamali.gov.za)

In the meantime, you can continue uploading and documenting your datasets. You will not be able to make them public until you are part of an organisation.

Once they have added you to your organisation, you will be able to make your datasets public.

### Handling requests

To be able to contribute data/analyses, a contributor must be added to an organisation for which they are authorised to publish on vulekamali.

If their organisation exists, they should just be added as an Admin or an Editor. If their organisation does not exist yet, first create the organisation. They ought to submit a form which sends its result to [an online spreadsheet with the details of their organisation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VQmoAQVf4rskF48JXmY1OIEnBj4QMholLQ-wNPp0tbw/edit#gid=246380462).

Before adding an organisation, National Treasury has to authorise the organisation to be added. Do not add an organisation without this approval.

1. [Double-check that the organisation does not exist yet](https://data.vulekamali.gov.za/organization)
2. Add the organisation
3. Update their contact details on the edit page for the organisation
4. Add any approved members with the appropriate roles
5. Ensure that any datasets they have already added are now owned by the organisation and marked Public.
6. E-mail them to let them know.
