# March: Division of Revenue Act is gazetted

When the Division of Revenue Act is gazetted, the individual grant frameworks should be uploaded one document per grant, so make it easier to understand the grants.

## Steps

1. Get the final gazetted version of the grant frameworks in per-grant documents
   1. in the past [we've split them out of the original PDF - see example](../operations-actions/adding-modifying-information-on-the-site/adding-conditional-grant-frameworks.md#example-of-splitting-out-framework-pages)
2. [Upload them](../operations-actions/adding-modifying-information-on-the-site/adding-conditional-grant-frameworks.md)

## Responsible roles

* Content Manager
* Metadata Editor

## Data requirements

* Gazetted conditional grant frameworks - Budget Office \(Steve Kenyon or Zethu Ncube\)
  * They provide the DoRA PDF which then needs to be split into per-grant PDFs.
