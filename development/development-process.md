# Development process

## Pivotal \(source of truth, stories\)

When planning, designing and developing a new user story, it is very important to have a single source of truth in order for multiple team members to be able to work together effectively.

During the planning phase:

* Include visual planning aids
* Clearly define the expected outcome of the story, i.e. what the expected outcome is.
* Further, narrow down to expected outcomes for front-end and backend:
  * What data is expected, and in which format?
  * ..

During the development phase:

* Create tasks for items that can be 'ticked off'
* Indicate which items are blocking others
* ..

During the staging phase:

* When you find a bug:
  * Screenshot and add as a comment
  * Create task and link to screenshot
  * Let the relevant developer know there's something they need to pay attention to
