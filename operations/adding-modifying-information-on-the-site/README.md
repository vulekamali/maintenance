## Dataset names and descriptions

Dataset names and descriptions, and resources that are part of a dataset, are maintained in the [DataStore](../../services/vulekamali-datastore/). 

If you want to upload lots of new documents, please have a look at the [Bulk-uploading](bulk-uploading-department-specific-documents.md) feature.

## Data summaries and charts on department pages

Data summaries and charts are based on

* One or more datasets in the [Datastore](../../services/vulekamali-datastore/)
* The[ Data Manager](../../services/vulekamali-data-manager/) making the summary or chart data available in [Page Data](../../services/vulekamali.gov.za.md#page-data) for vulekamali.gov.za
  * querying the relevant Data API\(s\) for the right data for that page
  * perhaps transforming the data to be easy to use in vulekamali.gov.za
* vulekamali.gov.za presenting the data found in Page Data to the user
