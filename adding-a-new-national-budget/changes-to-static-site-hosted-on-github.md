# Changes to static site hosted on Github

* Add the consolidated expenditure summary by adding a file of the [same structure as a previous year](https://github.com/OpenUpSA/static-budget-portal/blob/master/_data/2018-19/government_functions.yaml), based on the summary of consolidated expenditure in the Budget Guide.
* Add new [additional resource links](https://github.com/OpenUpSA/static-budget-portal/blob/master/_data/2018-19/manual_resources.yaml) to vulekamali
* Update the `latest_year` value in the [config file \(on line 23\)](https://github.com/OpenUpSA/static-budget-portal/blob/master/_config.yml).
* Update the [selection of years \(`YEAR_SLUGS`\)shown on the site in the static site data generator](https://github.com/OpenUpSA/static-budget-portal/blob/master/generate/from_dynamic.py#L23)
* The data for vulekamali must be [rebuilt](../adding-modifying-information-on-the-site/development-process.md), previewed, and uploaded when ready to publish the updated site.
