# Adding a new Division of Revenue bill

## Locating the Division of Revenue bill

It can be found on[ National Treasury's website](http://www.treasury.gov.za) under "Budget Information -&gt; National -&gt; {YEAR}"

## Upload to CKAN

The Division of Revenue bill must be uploaded to the [CKAN](https://data.vulekamali.gov.za/).

On the dataset in CKAN, there should be:

* One DOR per financial year
* One dataset per DOR
* Two resources per DOR dataset

Each year's Division of Revenue bill should be a separate dataset with:

* One PDF resource \(Division of Revenue bill\)
* One XLS resource \(Annexes\)
* Financial Year set to the correct year

Use the naming convention from previous years.

Each DOR should be in the "Division of Revenue Bills" group.

## Adding to vulekamali

After the dataset has been uploaded to CKAN, it should show up at [https://vulekamali.gov.za/datasets/division-of-revenue-bills](https://vulekamali.gov.za/datasets/division-of-revenue-bills).
