# Adding a new Division of Revenue bill

## Locating the Division of Revenue bill

It can be found on[ National Treasury's website](http://www.treasury.gov.za) under "Budget Information -&gt; National -&gt; {YEAR}"

## Upload to DataStore

The Division of Revenue bill must be uploaded to the [DataStore](https://data.vulekamali.gov.za/).

On the DataStore, there should be:

* One DOR per financial year
* One dataset per DOR
* Two resources per DOR dataset

Each year's Division of Revenue bill should be a separate dataset with:

* One PDF resource \(Division of Revenue bill\)
* One XLS resource \(Annexes\)
* Financial Year set to the correct year

Use the naming convention from previous years.

Each DOR should be in the "Division of Revenue Bills" group.

## Adding to vulekamali

After the dataset has been uploaded to the DataStore, the vulekamali [site data will be rebuilt](../../operations-actions/adding-modifying-information-on-the-site/#delay-in-updates-reflecting-on-vulekamali-gov-za) and it should show up at [https://vulekamali.gov.za/datasets/division-of-revenue-bills](https://vulekamali.gov.za/datasets/division-of-revenue-bills) when the build completes.

**Note:** Rebuilds are triggered when datasets are uploaded or changed, so this means that if you upload the dataset and add it to a group afterwards, a second rebuild will be triggered and you'll have to wait for the second rebuild to finish before the DOR will show up on vulekamali.
