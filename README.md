## Manual Structure

This manual is structured as follows:

### Standard Operations

Intended audience: Website/data administrators

Regular, repeated actions are documented step-by-step in the top level pages, like [Bulk-uploading department-specific documents](operations-actions/adding-modifying-information-on-the-site/bulk-uploading-department-specific-documents.md).

### Service overview

Intended audience: All administrators and developers

Services are documented under the 'Services' category, outlining what each service provides. e.g. the main website, and the datastore where datasets are organised.

### Design overview

Intended audience: software developers, visual designers, product developers

For developers, instructions and information regarding developing and staging/deploying software for each service is also included on each service page, like [Data Manager](services/vulekamali-data-manager/)

### Development and hosting details

For specific instructions on how to install or configure a service web app, please see the relevant README on the project's Github repository. An example of this can be seen on the [Data Manager github repository](https://github.com/OpenUpSA/vulekamali-datamanager).
