# vulekamali Datastore

## Functions

The [DataStore ](https://data.vulekamali.gov.za/)is used to manage the data displayed on Vulekamali, for example \(but not limited to\):

### [Datasets](https://data.vulekamali.gov.za/dataset)

Datasets contain structured data

* Adjusted Estimates of Expenditure data
* Annual Report data
* Estimates of Provincial Expenditure data

### [Groups ](https://data.vulekamali.gov.za/group)\(Vulekamali categories\)

Groups allow us to categorise datasets

* Adjusted Budget Vote Documents
* Bills of Revenue
* Estimates of Provincial Expenditure

## Best Practices

* If your dataset exists across multiple financial years, create one dataset per financial year.
* It is better to upload documents rather than link to them - links can go stale.
* Dataset **titles** and **slugs** should be human readable i.e. contain full names instead of acronyms.
* No duplication.
* Include data for each financial year available.
* If you've deleted a dataset or resource - be sure to purge it afterwards, otherwise it won't actually be deleted.
