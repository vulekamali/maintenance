# Adding Admin users

Data Manager admins can make other users admins.

## Get the user's username

After the user [logs in at https://datamanager.vulekamali.gov.za/accounts/login](https://datamanager.vulekamali.gov.za/accounts/login), the page homepage will show their username in the notice after _"Successfully signed in as "_. If they are already logged in, ask them to [log out ](https://datamanager.vulekamali.gov.za/accounts/logout)and log back in again to find their username and provide it.

You might also be able to find them in the [user list](https://datamanager.vulekamali.gov.za/admin/auth/user/), but be sure to check that their e-mail address is what you expect, in case someone else with a similar name already has an account.

## Make the user an administrator

When you have their username, find it in the [user list](https://datamanager.vulekamali.gov.za/admin/auth/user/), and click on their username to edit their user account.

Ensure the "Superuser status" and "Staff status" checkboxes are checked, and click Save.
