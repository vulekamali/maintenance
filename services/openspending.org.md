# openspending-dedicated.vulekamali.gov.za

We use OpenSpending to provide an API to the fiscal data. When uploaded, dataset columns must be classified according to the [Fiscal Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/fiscal-data-package/) types.

OpenSpending was previously hosted at openspending.org. Since its hosting was discontinued, a fork of the code has been hosted for National Treasury to provide continuity. OpenSpending is open source software allowing for the continued hosting despite discontinuation by the original vendor.

We add the datasets under the info@vulekamai.gov.za user.
